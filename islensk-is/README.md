# Íslensk-ensk Orðabók

This is a small part of my greater English Icelandic glossary project.

For now the software is available under the BSD-3 Clause license while the
original zoega dictionary text located in files is available under CC0 1.0
Universal.

This creation is partially inspired by a comment from here:
https://github.com/sveinbjornt/ensk.is/issues/6#issuecomment-2219309378 
> I have given some thought to OCR-ing Zoega's Icelandic-English dictionary, but the truth is that the English-Icelandic one has been so much editorial work, quite apart from fixes and additions, that I do not feel up to repeating the experience. If you want to give it a shot, go for it!

and just partially from chatting with friends and my own frustrations from
learning Icelandic.
