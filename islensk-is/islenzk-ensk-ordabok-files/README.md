# Íslensk-ensk Orðabók

This creation is partially inspired by a comment from here:

> I have given some thought to OCR-ing Zoega's Icelandic-English dictionary, but the truth is that the English-Icelandic one has been so much editorial work, quite apart from fixes and additions, that I do not feel up to repeating the experience. If you want to give it a shot, go for it!

and just partially from chatting with friends and my own frustrations from
learning Icelandic.
